Dog Years

Another JS mini project I learned from CodeCademy!

This code calculates my age in dog years and displays the result in the console. My age in human years is stored in the constant myAge and is 23. The first two years my life, which are considered to be 10.5 dog years each, are calculated and stored in the earlyYears variable. The remaining years are then calculated and stored in the laterYears variable. My total age in dog years is stored in the myAgeInDogYears variable and is the sum of earlyYears and laterYears. My name is stored in the myName constant and is converted to lowercase. The result is displayed in the console using string interpolation.
